# ðŸŒ¾ CropPredictionSystem

A Machine Learning-based application to predict the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental and soil parameters. Built with a modular pipeline for preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit.

ðŸš€ Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.

Model Selection: Trains multiple models and selects the best-performing one.

User-Friendly Interface: Interactive predictions through a Streamlit web app.

Modular Code Structure: Easy to maintain and scale.

ðŸ§© Pipeline Workflow
Data Ingestion: Load and explore raw data.

EDA: Understand data patterns, distributions, and correlations.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and remove outliers.

Feature Engineering: Transform and create new features.

Data Splitting: Train-test split.

Model Training: Train multiple ML models and calculate error metrics.

Model Selection: Pick the best model based on performance.

Deployment: Predict crops using user input via Streamlit.
